          Hello there! I'm a 3rd-year student of informatics engineering at Hasanuddin University, love collaborating and making connections. I have an interest in technology and social issues. A person who always wants to move forward likes to discuss and find solutions to problems. Have organizational experience in the field of event management, content creation, and people development. And lately, learning about UI/UX Design.
